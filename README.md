# NYC Leading Causes of Death API

A simple Flask API built on the NYC "Leading Causes of Death" dataset.  
Supports listing records, filtering by column, pagination (limit/offset), retrieving a single record by id, and output in JSON or CSV. Remember to use the pretty-print button otherwise it would look a bit messy.

## Setup

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
